# Computer Science Project (COMP3900): Foodle - A Recipe Recommendation System
This project was conducted during 2022 Term 2 as part of the UNSW course COMP3900.

## Overview
Foodle is an interactive recipe recommendation system, where users can match their ingredients to suitable recipes. This project mainly aims to:
- Help users minimise food waste in their households
- Provides users with tools which can help with ingredient and meal preparation
- Allows users to share their own knowledge on ingredients and recipes

Our target demographic are mainly:
- Young adults and adults who lack experience in cooking and meal planning
- More experienced home cooks who want to share their knowledge or get new ideas

Our main functionalities include:
- Storing a personalised list of ingredients, for which you can find recipes based off
- Storing and saving recipes onto personalised lists, and a calendar to assist with meal planning. 
- User contribution where you can add your own recipes.
- Account functionality to save and store user ingredients, lists, and calendars 

The design of the website is minimalist, to highlight the importance of the recipes, and to aid the ease of use and navigation. We also have one main colour, a pale lime green, which is used sparingly in important places, such as the header and buttons. 

The Foodle interface is a web page where you are able to access the functionality of the website. This webpage was created using the React and Material UI libraries. Using the website provides a responsive experience, as elements are updated in real time, providing immediate user feedback and delivering a more fulfilling user experience.
